When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I left my computer at home or office.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be some commits that I do not need to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches occur within a repository.
    Forks occur on GitHub. Each fork is a repository on GitHub.
    Clones are any repositories cloned from another repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    While you've made new commits on your local machine, others might have
    pushed new commits to GitHub.
    Then, merging is needed.
    The 'copy of the last known state of the remote' acts as the diverging point.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I definitely will use Git and GitHub. Using these makes collaborating much
    easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I want to add or change a feature.
