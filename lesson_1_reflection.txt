How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was helpful because it pinpoints the exact location that I do not
    have to look through the whole file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Sometimes you might want to go back to an old version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: each commit has a logical change.
    Con: sometimes developers might forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Sometimes multilple files are interrelated. ex) html, css, javascript files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: shows the history of commits (git log --stat)
    git diff: shows difference between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I have to worry less, because I can switch between commits by using 'git checkout'.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    EVERYTHING!!
