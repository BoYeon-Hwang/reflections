What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    '.git' directory is added but no commits are added.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The 'staging area' is where commit candidates are placed. Users can choose
    files from the 'working directory' and place them on the 'staging area'.
    Then, if the files on the 'staging area' get commited, they finally get
    into the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    by using 'git diff --staged', I can compare changes between the staging area
    and the latest commit in the repository

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    experimenting some features while keeping the main branch(= master branch).

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    Drawing each commit pointing at its parent/parents visualizes the reachability.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    The merged branch points to all of its parents. And git log shows all of its
    parent branches by time each commit was commited.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    Pro: it is fast.
    Con: conflicts might occur.
